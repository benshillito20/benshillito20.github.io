            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Ben Shillito, I am currently studying computer science at Sheffield Hallam university. I am
                in my second year, however I have been programming for over 5 years now.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have experience working as part of a team; several of the projects I have undertaken at university and
                even at secondary school involved coordinating with other students as part of a team to develop
                software, utilising multiple different design strategies and philosophies. I achieved over 70% in four
                of the modules in my first year.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have always had an interest in programming and problem solving, and have been working on these skills
                consistently. My main interest in the computer science field is procedural generation. I have several
                other academic intersts and in my first year at university I attended
                debating society regularly.
            </p>
            <p>
                My goal is to work for myself as an independant programmer after I graduate from university.
